# Editing Input Data (Publisher) Connectors and Subscriber Connectors

By default, all Input Data (Publisher) Connectors and Subscriber Connectors include only the filename of the file being published or subscribed to. You must edit these connectors to include the full path to the files.

To determine if a window includes a connector, look for the <img src='../images/connector_icon.png'>  icon. If the icon appears on the left of a window it indicates a publisher connector exists. If the icon appears on the right of a window it indicates a subscriber connector.
